# packet-sniffer-gui-python
A network packet sniffer developed using Pythonâ€™s Tkinter for the graphical user interface and Scapy for packet capture and analysis. It allows users to select a network interface and optionally apply a capture filter to begin monitoring live network traffic. Captured packets are processed in real time using multithreading to avoid blocking the GUI, with each packet being displayed in a tabular format showing key details such as timestamp, source and destination addresses, protocol, packet length, and brief info.

Users can start or stop the sniffing process, clear the display, and view detailed information about any selected packet. The details section includes breakdowns by protocol (Ethernet, IP, TCP, UDP), human-readable summaries, and a hex dump of the raw packet data. For TCP packets, the payload is attempted to be decoded as UTF-8 text and shown if readable. The application queues captured packets for safe thread communication and enforces a maximum packet limit of 1000 to avoid memory overuse. It dynamically fetches available network interfaces, and provides real-time interaction.
